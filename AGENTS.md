## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

Rules:
- ALWAYS read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md before reading any source files, running grep/glob searches, or answering codebase questions. The graph is your primary map of the codebase.
- IF graphify-out/wiki/index.md EXISTS, navigate it instead of reading raw files
- For cross-module "how does X relate to Y" questions, prefer `graphify query "<question>"`, `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"`, or `graphify explain "<concept>"` over grep — these traverse the graph's EXTRACTED + INFERRED edges instead of scanning files
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).

## Study OS frontend contract

Each surface has one source of truth. Do not cross-wire them:

- `/app/study/home` (StudyHome.jsx) → `/api/study/mission-control` for the
  active plan, today's tasks, and focus rollup. The weekly report card is a
  separate fetch (`/api/study/report-card*`) because mission-control does
  not include it.
- `/app/study/plan` (StudyPlan.jsx) → `/api/study/plan/draft`,
  `/api/study/plan/apply`, `/api/study/plan/timeline`. Different contract;
  no overlap with mission-control.
- `/app/today` (Today.jsx) → the dashboard hook only. It is intentionally a
  general action/application overview after the PR3 reorg. **Never call
  `/api/study/mission-control` from `/app/today`.**
- `competition_context` reads `reviewer_status in ('locked','reviewed')`
  (locked preferred). UI copy must say "reviewed or locked rows feed the
  planner; locked preferred" — not "locked only".
